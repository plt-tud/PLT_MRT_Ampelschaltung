# The PLT/MRT Trafficlight

This repository contains the schematics and pcb board masks for the traffic light that is used as a lecture example in the Microcomputingtechnology 1 and 2 courses of the Chair for *Process Control and Process Systems Engineering Working Group*. While students are provided with instructions on how to create a simple example circuit using bread boards, this PCB gives them a more durable, multi-purpose I/O circuit.

## Schematics

Schematics a are included in the `schem` folder and can be edited using [GNU Schem](http://wiki.geda-project.org/geda:gaf#utilities_for_schematics), part of the GEDA project.

You can find printable PDF Versions of the schematic in `doc` (Postscript and PDF).

## Board Layout

An example board layout is included in `pcb` and can be edited using [GNU PCB](http://pcb.geda-project.org), part of the GEDA project.

You can find printable PDF Versions of the board and drill masks in `doc` (Postscript and PDF).
